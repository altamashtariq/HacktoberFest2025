* Describe the role of the **widget tree**, **element tree**, and **render tree** in Flutter.
* Explain how changes in the widget tree propagate to the render tree and trigger UI updates.

## 2. What is the difference between `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` in Flutter, and when should each be used?

* Discuss **immutability** of `StatelessWidget` and **mutable state** in `StatefulWidget`.
* Provide scenarios where each type is appropriate.

## 3. Explain Flutter’s `InheritedWidget` and how it differs from using `Provider` or other state management solutions.

* Define **InheritedWidget** and how it allows data to propagate down the widget tree.
* Compare with **Provider**, highlighting advantages for readability and testability.

## 4. Dart Coding Question 1: Reverse a Linked List

Given a singly linked list, write a Dart function to **reverse the list in-place** and return the new head.

### Example:

* Input:

```dart
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

* Output:

```dart
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

## 5. Dart Coding Question 2: Find the First Non-Repeating Character

Given a string `s`, write a Dart function that returns the **first non-repeating character**. If all characters repeat, return `null`.

### Example:

* Input:

```dart
"leetcode"
```

* Output:

```dart
'l'
```

## 6. Dart Coding Question 3: Maximum Subarray Sum

Given an array of integers, write a Dart function to find the **maximum sum of a contiguous subarray**.

### Example:

* Input:

```dart
[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
```

* Output:

```dart
6
```

* Explanation: `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum = 6.
